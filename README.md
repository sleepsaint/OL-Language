#OL Language

OL is "One Line". So it is very simple and easy to use.
OL is designed to get value from a tree. It regards a tree as an object and use a serial of "." to get value like javascript. And it use a same way as LISP to describe function just like `(function-name param1 param2)`. So, OL can also be called "Object LISP".
